#  4-Servo Humanoid Walking Robot  
*A beginner-friendly Arduino project simulating human walking using servo motors*

---

##  Overview

This project showcases a minimal yet effective **humanoid robot** that simulates walking using just **four micro servo motors** and an **Arduino Uno R3**. Designed as an introductory robotics and motion-control experiment, the robot performs a **servo sweep test** and executes a **step-by-step walking sequence** using basic servo programming.

##  Key Features

-  Servo sweep test (0° → 180° → 0°)
-  Basic walking motion with right/left leg control
-  Servo stabilization at 90° (neutral standing pose)

##  Walking Algorithm

```plaintext
Step 0: Set all joints to 90° (neutral pose)

1. Lift right leg
   - Right Knee → 60°
   - Right Hip → 70°

2. Swing right leg forward
   - Right Hip → 110°

3. Lower right leg
   - Knee & Hip → Return to 90°

4. Shift weight

5. Repeat for left leg
